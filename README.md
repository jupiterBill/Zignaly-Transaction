# Zignaly Transaction Analysis

This project is a solution to the **Technical Assessment ‚Äì Support/Data Ops** for Zignaly.  
The goal was to build a script that can analyze transaction data for a given account up to a specific cutoff timestamp, calculate balances, and present the results in a way that is both **useful and easy to understand**.

## üß† Reasoning Behind the Solution

When approaching this assessment, the main goal was to design a script that could process a CSV file of mock transactions, filter them by account and cutoff timestamp, and then generate both numeric summaries and a running balance visualization gave seriouse consideration to using Google cloud api for automatic upload to googlesheets but it seemed a little unncessary additionally i might forget to remove my payment details and i do not want to get charged for a service i barely use üòÇ.

We started by focusing on **data clarity and reproducibility**:

1. **Filtering by account & cutoff timestamp**

   - Transactions are filtered based on the provided account name and cutoff timestamp.
   - This ensures the script only considers relevant records, which is important for scalability when handling large datasets.

2. **Running Balance Computation**

   - Instead of just looking at ‚Äúeffect‚Äù (income/expenditure), we created a dedicated **running balance column** that accumulates the balance over time.
   - This gives a more accurate representation of account health.

3. **Summaries**

   - The script calculates:
     - Final balance
     - Total income vs. expenditure
     - Totals by transaction type
     - Largest transaction
     - Most frequent transaction type
   - These insights make the dataset more actionable rather than just raw numbers.

4. **Visualization**

   - A running balance line chart was added with a dynamic label at the latest point to show the current balance.
   - The label color is **green if the final balance is positive**, and **red if it is negative**, giving instant visual feedback.

5. **Export Options**
   - The results are written to an Excel sheet for further analysis.
   - Additionally, we added an option to embed the summaries into an image so they can be shared or reported easily.

This solution balances **functionality, readability, and extendability** so it can evolve if more requirements are introduced later.
